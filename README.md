This is a RREF-Calculator I made for my math 220 class

It takes any sized matrix (m x n), where "m" is the number of rows and "n" is the number of columns, and asks for the corresponding digits and then 1) displays the original matrix and 2) displays the matrix in reduced row echelon form (RREF)

This is my first project!

NOTE: So far, unless updated, it can take in any whole, real numbers i.e. it can not take in fractions at the moment.
